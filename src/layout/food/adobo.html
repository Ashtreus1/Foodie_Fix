            <li>
                <strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken or pork with the soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, and chopped onion. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Meat:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pot or deep pan over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat, including the marinade. Cook until the meat is browned on all sides.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add Water and Simmer:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour in the water, add the bay leaves and whole peppercorns. Bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat and let it simmer uncovered for about 30-45 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency. Stir occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season and Finish:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you prefer a slightly sweet adobo, add 1 teaspoon of sugar and stir well.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>For a thicker sauce, you can continue to simmer until the sauce reduces further.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve:</strong>
